React: Off the Grid
Creating a React application for orphans in Ghana offered some unique challenges. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are more than just "cool" or "hip" — they can be really important for applications where the internet is spotty, if available at all. Learn why I chose React + AWS Lambda for a country with poor internet connectivity, and general lessons on the often messy and exciting world of creating offline applications.

Translating React
We often use React and write JSX without thinking about the syntax. But what’s React actually doing under the hood? What’s the JavaScript look like? Let’s translate React into JavaScript, transpile that and see what we get. Let’s pick apart what React is really doing and get at the heart of it. We’ll talk about the importance and usefulness of knowing its baselines for beginners and experts alike. We'll gain a clearer understanding of where React’s magic originates. So the next time you use React or write JSX, you’ll be secretly translating in your head for deeper insight and edification.

Simply React
Don't you love how easy it is to encapsulate UI code into a React component? I do! Despite this, making those same components reusable can be a challenge. Our components often start simple, but then they have to adapt as unforeseen use cases come up. This often results in a growing list of props and complex implementation full of if statements and a confusing API. An inevitable rewrite of the component eventually hits and now we have two problems.

Let's take a step back and consider some things we can do upfront to keep our components flexible, simple, and optimized for inevitable change.
